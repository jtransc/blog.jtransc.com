I have created a [slack team chat](https://jtransc.slack.com/) and a [google groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jtransc).

## <i class="fa fa-slack"></i> Slack

Slack is a messaging/chat app that works on browsers and have native apps
for desktop and mobile.

With slack you will be able to ask or comment stuff in realtime.
You will have to first request an invite ([it is automated](https://jtransc-slack.herokuapp.com/))
then you will be able to login.

1. <i class="fa fa-sign-in"></i> [Request automated invite](https://jtransc-slack.herokuapp.com/)
2. <i class="fa fa-comment"></i> [Login](https://jtransc.slack.com/)

## <i class="fa fa-users"></i> Google Groups

I have also created a google group yo discuss stuff in a slower-pace forum way :)
